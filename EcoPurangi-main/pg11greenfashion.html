            <h2>1. 3D Virtual Sampling</h2>
            <p>In the past, physical samples have been a necessity in the design and buying and selling lifecycle. These samples provide both designers and the retail buying teams an accurate representation of the product, but one finished style can require 20 or more samples before production. However, as 3D technology evolves, virtual sampling already enables a digital full line review which reduces waste in both design and product development.</p>

            <h2>2. Alternative Textiles</h2>
            <p>Materials commonly used in clothing take considerable resources and often degrade slowly. The creation of one cotton shirt requires the same amount of water as one person drinks in 2.5 years. Synthetic materials like nylon and polyester use less water during production but emit dangerous greenhouse gases.</p>

            <h2>3. Automation and Fashion on Demand</h2>
            <p>Fast fashion businesses and mass production models have contributed to vast amounts of waste and returns. Marketers pushed mass consumption on consumers and this mindset fueled this model over the 1990’s and 2000’s. But as the rise of e-commerce and social commerce over the last decade has created an entirely new business model, consumers are now in the driver’s seat, and they care a lot about both personalized experiences and the planet. On-demand design and manufacturing will play a significant role in the future of fashion. Instead of producing clothes and then selling them, the items are ordered then produced. While today single and small batch production costs more to manufacture, automation and innovation in manufacturing combined with the money saved with reduced returns and guaranteed sales will offset these costs over time.</p>
